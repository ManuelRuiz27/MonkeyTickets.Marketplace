 * This package exports TypeScript types generated from the OpenAPI specification.
 * These types are used by both the backend API and frontend web application
 * to ensure type safety across the entire stack.
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: Do not manually edit the types.ts file. It is auto-generated.
 * To update types, modify openapi/monomarket-tickets.yaml and run:
 *   pnpm run contracts:generate
 * 
 * @see openapi/monomarket-tickets.yaml for the source of truth
